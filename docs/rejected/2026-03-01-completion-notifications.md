## Reason

Good idea but not the right time. Current TUI dashboard provides enough visibility for solo developer workflow.

## Original Evidence Summary

- Solo devs running tasks in background need to know when to review PRs without watching the TUI
- Basic feature but missing from all CLI agent orchestrators
- Implementation would be straightforward (macOS native, Slack webhook, or custom webhook)

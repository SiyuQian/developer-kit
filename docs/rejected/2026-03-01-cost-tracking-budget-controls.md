## Reason

Good idea but not the right time. Solo developer usage doesn't yet warrant the investment in cost tracking infrastructure.

## Original Evidence Summary

- Unpredictable cost is the #1 unsolved pain point across all CLI AI agents; solo devs pay $100-300/month out of pocket
- Stream-json output already contains token data, making implementation relatively straightforward
- No competitor offers per-task cost tracking for CLI agents

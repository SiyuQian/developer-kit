## Reason

Good idea but not the right time. Trello integration works well enough for current solo developer workflow. GitHub Issues integration would add significant value when expanding to team use or when GitHub Agentic Workflows matures.

## Original Evidence Summary

- GitHub is where most solo devs already live; reduces friction vs. maintaining a separate Trello board
- GitHub Agentic Workflows (the biggest competitive threat) is still in preview
- No CLI orchestrator currently reads from GitHub Issues as a task source

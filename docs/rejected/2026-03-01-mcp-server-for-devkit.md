## Reason

Good idea but not the right time. MCP ecosystem is still maturing and the CLI workflow is sufficient for current needs. Would become more valuable as MCP adoption grows and when the tool expands beyond solo use.

## Original Evidence Summary

- MCP is becoming the "USB-C for AI applications" — adopted by OpenAI, Google DeepMind, Sourcegraph
- Exposing devkit as an MCP server would make it a native part of the Claude Code ecosystem
- No orchestration tool currently exposes itself as an MCP server; would be a unique differentiator

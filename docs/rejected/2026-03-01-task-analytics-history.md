## Reason

Good idea but not the right time. Need more task execution data before analytics becomes meaningful.

## Original Evidence Summary

- Solo devs need feedback loops to optimize their plans and skills
- Currently logs go to files and are never aggregated
- No CLI agent tool provides execution analytics; would be a unique differentiator

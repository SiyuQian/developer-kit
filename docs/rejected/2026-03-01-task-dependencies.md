## Reason

Doesn't align with product vision. The Developer Kit focuses on simple, independent task execution. Adding DAG-based task dependencies would add significant complexity without matching how solo developers typically work — they can simply order cards manually on the Trello board.

## Original Evidence Summary

- Complex features need ordered execution (e.g., "create DB schema" before "build API endpoint")
- No competitor supports task DAGs for AI coding agents
- High implementation complexity (feasibility 1/3) relative to value for solo developer use case
